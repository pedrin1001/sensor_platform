Sensor Platform
=================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pedroscaff/sensor-platform.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pedroscaff/sensor-platform)

Sensor Platform is an Arduino based tool to acquire, geolocate and save pollutants
concentrations in a sd card. The current version is focused on CO2.

It was developed as part of my [bachelor thesis](https://bitbucket.org/pedroscaff/thesis-research/downloads/).
There is another repository ([sensor-platform-data-analysis](https://github.com/pedroscaff/sensor-platform-data-analysis)) with tools to process and visualize the data on a map.
